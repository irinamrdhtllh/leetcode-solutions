# Palindrome Number

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1**
```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: x = -121
Output: true
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-.
```

**Example 3**
```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads as 01 from right to left.
```

**Constrains:**
- `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`
